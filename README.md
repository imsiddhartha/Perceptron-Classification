Implemented Linear Discriminant Functions based on various approaches such as Perceptron criterion function and Mean Squared Error.


DATASET:
	The data set to be used for the exercises given below is the following sample set comprising a two-class problem.
	Class1 = [(1; 6); (7; 2); (8; 9); (9; 9); (4; 8); (8; 5)]
	Class2 = [(2; 1); (3; 3); (2; 4); (7; 1); (1; 3); (5; 2)]

Implementation:
	Implement the following algorithms:
		1. Single-sample perceptron
		2. Single-sample perceptron with margin
		3. Relaxation algorithm with margin
		4. Widrow-Hoff or Least Mean Squared (LMS) Rule
